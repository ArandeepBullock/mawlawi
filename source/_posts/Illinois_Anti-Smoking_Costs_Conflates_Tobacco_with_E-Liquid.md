Two bills found in the Illinois status legislature want to raise the legal age group limit to get tobacco from 18 to 21 building Illinois the sixth talk about to do so during the past year.

Simply the bill classifies e-liquids - even non-nicotine versions - just as 'tobacco items' and would, therefore, put all types of e-juices out of grab some younger vapers.

The parallels being drawn between tobacco and e-liquids have left some vapers worried about their usage of e-juices being restricted as a result of a false equivalency. Vape store owners are also thinking about whether their businesses will be damaged by the proposed legislation.

Sen. Julie Morrison (D-Deerfield), a sponsor of one of the charges, gave no description as to the reasons e-liquids were being equated with tobacco goods in the brand new bill's wording. In a affirmation produced to the press, the senator only spoke to the initial intentions of the costs.

The bill really wants to capitalize on the success that regional municipalities, including Greater Chicago, have had with reducing the amount of new teenage smokers. After Chicago approved a bill increasing the legal time limit to 21, metropolis observed a precipitous drop in teenage smoking.

In 2011, 13.6% of Chicago teens admitted to smoking cigarettes regularly.

When the study was taken again in 2017, one year following the age limit grew up, only 6% of teens admitted to smoking.

Based on the strength of those numbers, surrounding municipalities have followed suit and also have also raised this limit to 21. Such significant gains at the neighborhood level are what finally goaded talk about lawmakers into attempting to improve the age limit statewide.

'Adults rarely pick up a cigarette for the very first time,' Senator Morrison wrote found in her statement. 'Most up to date smokers initially tried tobacco by age 18, making reducing access to tobacco for teenagers consequently important'.

Only, not many people are happy about the opportunity of these bills passing. Vape store owners like Muhammed Mustafa succinctly characterized their thoughts about the proposed legislation with one phrase: 'pissed'.

Mustafa, the owner of Best found in the Smoker's World, has seen first-hand how teenage smoking has been on the decline even though vaping and e-cigarettes have become popular with the high-institution crowd. So he's specifically mystified why legislators 're going after a huge part of his organization: vaping products.

Thomas Allen, another vape shop owner, has a less pessimistic look at of the brand new legislation. He, of study course, applauds the actions being taken to prevent teenage smoking cigarettes, as long as the constraints against purchasing actually non-nicotine e-liquids are lifted.  

If e-liquids are given a reprieve and so are overlooked of the ban, Allen feels confident that those teenagers who walk into his store, and who are now banned from purchasing smoking cigarettes, can be persuaded to checking out vaping instead.

Allen is also unsure why e-liquids are being targeted despite the fact that nearly all his teenage clientele vape non-nicotine varieties of e-juice.

"Almost all of the 18- to 21-year-olds will be vaping with zero nicotine," Allen mentioned, "That becoming included with the tobacco makes zero sense". 

Allen hinted at the fact that the tobacco industry is usually behind the conflating of e-liquids and cigarettes. 'Young persons took to e-juices so much better than tobacco,' mentioned Allen, 'However the lobbying by the tobacco sector is what first got it to end up being the same.'

The two bills are awaiting another reading in both Residence and the Senate.

## A PAL Indeed? How Cannabis Can Help You Kick Other Negative Traits?

Cannabis has been having an excellent few of years. The thing no person could envision - the entire legalization of recreational marijuana (in some claims) - through the paranoia-soaked fog of the Battle on Medicines years is currently as clear possible as sunlight rising over Puget Sound.

With legalization has come a deluge of new companies that contain turned cannabis, in every its varied forms, into just another consumer merchandise, bought as if you would get a pack of cigarettes or a can of beer.

And running simply parallel to cannabis legislative successes is its developing acceptance as the best treatment choice for various circumstances among the medical and scientific communities.

Study after study features demonstrated the usefulness of cannabis, it is leaf and other styles like oil and edibles included, found in everything from pain operations, to treating muscles spasms and nausea.

Two recent analyses have only put into the already intensive body of work showing why cannabis is a worthy alternative to more traditional, pharmacological therapies for the treating various mental and physical disorders.

One study, published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, found that several Canadian respondents, oftentimes, substituted other, more habit-forming substances just like prescription opioids and antidepressants, for marijuana to take care of their conditions. The study was done to measure the effectiveness of a fresh drug policy set up just a couple of years ago.

The second study implies a potential use for vaping cannabis as a harm reduction remedy for the cessation of tobacco use. The analysis explores the close relationship between cannabis and tobacco intake and how the vaping of marijuana, (without tobacco, without combustion), might help disassociate the effects of nicotine from the consequences of cannabis.

## The Many Faces of Cannabis

Marijuana has been legal for medical use in Canada since 2001. In 2014, a modification to regulations was introduced that would allow for the growth of the amount of certified marijuana growers and cultivators.

A survey was done of the sufferers who had employed the new multi-producer program to measure their pleasure and use habits. All of the patients in the analysis possessed medical marijuana licenses and, as such, designed they experienced from afflictions both mental and physical.

The most prominent finding of the survey was the 63% of respondents who had substituted prescription medications for marijuana; prescription drugs, in this case, divided between painkillers (30%), benzodiazepines (16%) and antidepressants (12%).

Cannabis substitution also occurred where medical marijuana had substituted the standard use of alcoholic beverages (25%) and tobacco (12%). The study authors felt these findings not only supported previous research but they also reveal the specific circumstances that marijuana helps handle along with the particular medicines it replaces.

A somber counterweight to the study's enthusiastic results was that many of these surveyed, despite having their permissions, even now relied on illegitimate distributors to obtain supplies of marijuana.

In addition to the fact that despite being medically approved to get marijuana as a treatment, most users (near 55%) also had to pay service fees to be granted a medical marijuana pass, this demonstrates, as the authors suggest, more improvements are needed to the system. 

## A Diverging Path

Since marijuana and tobacco will be the most widely used substances on the globe, it only is practical to review how their complex chemistries impression one another. Several European experts has released their results about how marijuana use impacts a user's tobacco work with and vice-versa.

The study also manufactured a case for vaping marijuana - where in fact the plant is heated in an electrical device to produce a vapor stream, inhaled by an individual - as a potential method for aiding in the cessation of both tobacco and marijuana consumption. While the study does not betray any biased, pro-marijuana sentiment (quite contrary actually), it can note the value of taking into consideration cannabis in discussions on smoking cigarettes cessation practices.

The study queried respondents on the marijuana smoking habits, especially how often they combined tobacco to their marijuana spliffs or joints. Europe saw the highest percentage of smokers, between 70% and 90%, who admitted to frequently blending their marijuana with tobacco.

The practice of mixing tobacco and marijuana was much less prevalent, nevertheless, in Canada and America, 16%, and 4% respectively than in Europe. The researchers then discovered that a sizable number of these no-mix smokers had began vaping cannabis, instead of traditionally smoking it.

The study then produces the jump to arguing for vaping cannabis as a strategy to wean marijuana users from marijuana, similar to how vaping e-cigarettes help smokers quit tobacco and, eventually, nicotine, altogether.

The authors built upon research that shows many marijuana smokers become addicted to nicotine because their joints are rolled with tobacco inside, which in turn makes it more challenging to quit both.

Since vaping offers users the probability of getting doses of either smoking or THC in a safer, non-combustible format, the experts argued, it should be considered an advisable treatment option for folks looking to curb cigarette smoking both tobacco and marijuana.

## More Questions than Answers

Regardless of the similarities between both of these seemingly vindicating studies, you may still find some differences within their conclusions, together with their intentions.

The Canadian study, that was geared more toward pointing out the inefficiencies of the distribution system, learned significant evidence regarding how marijuana can be utilised as an alternative drug to take care of many different ailments.  

The European study took the standpoint of trying to curb marijuana consumption altogether, along with tobacco use; 'dual-abstinence' within their words, 'As an excellent outcome from a wellbeing point of view.' The European paper did not issue scientific findings, a lot more than producing the suggestion that vaping marijuana certainly be a possible smoking cessation application.  

Either way, what both studies do show is usually a heightened interest on gathering evidence, but also initiating these scientific tests to begin with, of marijuana's different health insurance and psychological effects.

There is, no doubt, a mountain of evidence yet to be viewed and proven along marijuana's healing properties but both of these studies seem to demonstrate that progress is being made.
