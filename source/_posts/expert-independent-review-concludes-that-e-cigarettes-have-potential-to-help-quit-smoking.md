# For heavy smokers who cannot quit smoking immediately, E-cigarettes are the best alternatives for health concerns.

In August 2018, Public Health England published an evidence review. This review concludes that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than tobacco and have the potential to help smokers quit smoking. The review also states that nearly half the population (44.8%) don’t realize e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.

The comprehensive review finds that about 2.5 million people use e-cigarettes in England, PHE says, and 51 percent, almost 1.3 million, have stopped smoking entirely. Half of vapers who still smoke say they are using e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking or to prevent them from going back to cigarettes. The current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than tobacco.

According to research trials, the effectiveness of e-cigarette is similar with prescribed stop-smoking medicines and better than NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) products if these are used without any professional support. 

A rechargeable E-cigarette with a refillable tank delivers nicotine more effectively and quickly than a disposable model and is likely to give you a better chance of quitting smoking. For heavy smokers who cannot quit smoking immediately, E-cigarettes are also the best alternatives for health concerns. Major types of e-cigarette include cigalikes, vape pens, and mods. Mods are popular among heavy smokers, which come in a range of shapes and sizes, generally with longer lasting batteries. For many people, the choice between a cigalike, vape pen or mod will be based on how much they smoke. Generally, vape pen is good for all smokers.

If one is looking for an entry-level vape, the DOT Vape Kit could be a great option. This Kit is equipped with [new vaping technology](http://www.feelmtech.com/). The FEELM wicking and coil design are unique. Unlike tradition coil, FEELM uses a special ceramic cube with an integrated flat metal film to replace traditional coil. Two wires stick out of the bottom of the ceramic block for the connection, an S-shape metal film embedded in the bottom, which give clean and warm flavor. Such design by [FEELM](http://www.feelmtech.com/) also effectively avoids leaking, spitting, or popping. In addition, the plug-and-play design is very user-friendly.

“E-cigarettes are not completely risk free. But when compared to smoking, evidence shows they carry just a fraction of the harm. E-cigarettes are particularly effective when combined with expert help from a local stop smoking service.”, said Professor Kevin Fenton, the Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England.
